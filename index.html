      <p>Video games come in many different genres, each offering unique gameplay experiences. Three popular types of games are MOBAs (Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas), FPS (First-Person Shooters), and story-based games. In this post, we will compare these game types, looking at their characteristics and examples.</p>
      <p>MOBAs are a subgenre of strategy video games where players control a character as part of a team competing against another team. FPS games focus on gun and other weapon-based combat through the first-person perspective. Story-based games emphasize narrative and character development, offering rich, immersive experiences.</p>
