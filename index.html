      <p>Apples come in many shapes and sizes. They can be red, yellow,green and a mix of those colors. Some popular variants include: golden delicious, red delicious, gala, granny smith, cosmic crisp, and honey crisp. Luckily there is only one worth eating and it is the HONEY CRISP.</p>
      <p>Oranges are a good fruit nobody likes to peel them but when you cut them into slices they are great to eat, put on a drink, and they are great for orange juice a top 3 juice. See on an early morning you have some sausage, eggs, bacon, maybe even some pancakes and waffles, what are you going for? A glass of cranberry juice? A glass of milk? A glass of Apple Juice? Wrong Wrong Wrong. It is orange juice all the way and anybody who says differently is just wrong. OJ is the king of breakfast beverages.</p>
